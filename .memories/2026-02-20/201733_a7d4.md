## Added coa-codesearch-mcp as Reference Workspace

Tested the reference workspace feature end-to-end with a real project.

- **Setup:** Added `~/source/coa-codesearch-mcp` as Julie reference workspace (275 files, 8422 symbols)
- **Index rebuild:** 5840 code chunks (297 eros + 5543 coa-codesearch-mcp) + 30 doc chunks
- **Tests passed:**
  - Cross-workspace `semantic_search` returns results from both Python (eros) and C# (coa-codesearch-mcp)
  - Workspace-filtered search correctly scopes to single workspace
  - `find_similar` works across workspaces
- **Key observation:** Cross-project semantic matches work well — Eros's `semantic_search` tool matches coa-codesearch-mcp's `IsSemanticSearchAvailable` and `SemanticSymbolMatch` types
