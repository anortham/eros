## Server instructions + tool descriptions + .eros/.gitignore

### What
- Created `EROS_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (4KB) — comprehensive agent guidance matching Julie/Goldfish quality standards
- Upgraded all 4 tool descriptions from one-liners to multi-paragraph guides with usage context
- Added `readOnlyHint`/`idempotentHint` annotations to read-only tools
- Added `.eros/.gitignore` to prevent accidental vector store commits
- Instructions loaded into FastMCP via `instructions=` parameter with fallback path resolution

### Why
- Eros tools were "documentation-starved" — LLMs had no guidance on when/how to use them vs Julie
- Julie has 160+ lines of agent instructions; Goldfish has 82 lines; Eros had zero
- Tool descriptions were marketing copy, not behavioral guides

### Key decisions
- Kept instructions as a separate .md file (like Julie) rather than inline (like Goldfish) — easier to iterate
- `_load_instructions()` tries CWD first, then resolves relative to server.py — works in both dev and installed contexts
- Instructions emphasize "Julie first, Eros second" to prevent misuse
- `.eros/.gitignore` mirrors Julie's `*` + `!.gitignore` pattern

### Impact
- 55/55 tests passing
- Server needs restart for live testing
- All three changes (docs indexing, instructions, gitignore) ready for commit
