## Added EROS_WORKSPACE env var for VS Code/Copilot

### What
Added `EROS_WORKSPACE` environment variable matching the `JULIE_WORKSPACE` / `GOLDFISH_WORKSPACE` convention. Required for VS Code since its MCP integration doesn't pass `cwd`.

### How
- **config.py**: `EROS_WORKSPACE` checked first, `EROS_PROJECT_ROOT` as fallback, `cwd` as default. Added `.expanduser()` for tilde support.
- **README.md**: Full setup sections for Claude Code and VS Code/Copilot with `mcp.json` example. Configuration table with all env vars.
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated config table with `EROS_WORKSPACE` as primary, `EROS_PROJECT_ROOT` as legacy alias.

### Session summary
This session we shipped: doc indexing, CodeRankEmbed, agent instructions, clean tool output, EROS_WORKSPACE, dimension mismatch fix, silent fallback removal. All committed and pushed.
