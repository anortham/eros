## First live test of Eros MCP server

Successfully verified all 4 MCP tools are operational on the Eros semantic code intelligence server.

### What was tested
- **`semantic_index`**: `health`, `stats`, and `index` operations all work. Indexed 211 code chunks from Julie's symbol data.
- **`semantic_search`**: Returns meaningful results with scores in 0.61-0.71 range. Correctly found lazy loading code for a natural language query.
- **`find_similar`**: Finds related code and documentation for a given symbol.
- **`explain_retrieval`**: Shows score breakdown (embedding similarity only — no reranker yet).
- **Test suite**: 41/41 tests passing in 1.3s.

### Observations for future work
- **No docs indexed** — doc chunker found no documentation directories. README.md and CLAUDE.md exist but aren't picked up.
- **Explain is incomplete** — only embedding similarity shown; reranker, token overlap, and fusion weight fields are absent.
- **Lazy loading works** — MCP handshake completes fast, models load on demand via `asyncio.to_thread()`.

### Key files
- `python/eros/server.py` — 4 MCP tools
- `python/eros/lifecycle.py` — lazy loading / lifespan
- `python/eros/retrieval.py` — search routing, RRF fusion, result formatting
