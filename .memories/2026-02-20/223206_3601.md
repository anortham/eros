## Committed and pushed: logging, timing, CPU default

Commit `1181f10` on main — pushed to origin.

### What shipped:
- **File logging:** `.eros/logs/eros.log` with `RotatingFileHandler` (DEBUG, 5MB, 3 backups)
- **Timing:** Total/per-workspace/doc timing in `semantic_index` output + encode throughput in DEBUG logs
- **CPU default:** `EROS_DEVICE=cpu` by default, MPS caused kernel panics with large code chunks
- **EROS_DEVICE env var:** Users can opt into GPU with `auto`/`mps`/`cuda`
- **Lint cleanup:** Fixed pre-existing issues across all test files

### Verified before commit:
- 94 tests passing
- Lint clean (ruff)
- Live index test: 5864 chunks indexed in 331s on CPU, stable, no crashes
